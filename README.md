## Genetic Algorithm
![](docs/badge.svg)

Genetic Algorithm created for Dr. MacLennan's Biologically Inspired Computation course at the University of Tennessee

## Usage
```proj5 l n g Pm Pc```

* `l` – Length of the bitstrings
* `n` – Number of bitstrings in the population in a given generation
* `g` – Number of generations in a simulation
* `Pc` – Probability of Combinations
* `Pm` – Probability of Mutations

## Results
The program outputs to `stdout` in csv format, so you may pipe it into a file for any analysis. CSV will be split in to `avg-generation-fitness`, `max-generation-fitness`, `best-num-correct`
